# Seconds

Displays a system tray icon which displays the current time's seconds. Useful as Windows 11 does not currently have the ability to show the seconds in the system tray clock.

To stop the icon from being hidden inside the overflow menu, press Win+I to open settings, then navigate to `Personalisation -> Taskbar -> Other system tray icons`. Find the "Seconds" program in the list, and turn the slider to "On".

If you want the program to start with Windows, create a shortcut in your Start-up folder inside the Windows Start menu. You can find it here: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

Right click the icon to close the program.
